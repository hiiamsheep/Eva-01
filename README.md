## Introduction

The EVA-01 Mk01 is an simple UAV designed for various applications including surveillance, mapping, and research.

- Note: _This document may not be accurate, it will be updated along the project._

## Description

The EVA-01 is a long-range, low speed, autonomous unmanned plane capable of missions such as: payload delivery, surveillance, area mapping or research operations.

## Features

### Specifications

- **High aspect ratio wings**
- **V tail**
- **6s 1000mah battery**
- **300&hArr;700kv motor**
- **?x? propeller**
- **Ra-02 based communication (&plusmn;10km)**

### Navigation

- **Autonomous navigation**: The EVA-01 is capable of self-guidance to its target destination using integrated GPS and gyroscope.
- **Long range**: The UAV can keep communication to the ground station up to around 10km. After that, the full autonomous mode is enabled and will follow a predefined mission.

### Payload delivery

- **Airdrop**: The payload can be air-dropped at any moment or at a precise position.

### Reconaissance

- **Live Video**: The EVA-01 can be equiped with camera and send a real-time feed to the ground station.
- **Live Data**: The UAV can stream additional data such as telemetry (battery voltage, core temperatures and other debug data), its GPS position and heading.

### Mapping

- **Camera mapping**: The EVA-01 can take pictures of a large area and reassemble them into a single map.

### Research & Rescue

- If equipped with right equipement (such as thermal/IR camera), the EVA-01 can detect the heat signature of persons and transfer location to the ground station.
- **Payload**: The UAV can drop a payloand containing instructions or diverse supply to the detected person.
